# Furniture Shop App

I am currently trying to master flutter, and I built this app mainly for entertaining and educational purposes. It was built using flutter and contains two screens: A Home Screen and a Category Screen.

I hope you find it helpful in some way, shape, or form. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Thanks for your support on my YouTube channel. üôè
